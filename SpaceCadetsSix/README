An image circle detector. This software will detect all the structures that are likely to be a whole/partial circle in a standard image.

Due to the large number of loops required for the algorithm to take place, some limitations have been introduced:
  - The image is downscaled before the Hough transform takes place and MAX_TEST_SIZE = the maximum number of pixels in the scaled image.
  - The image's Sobel (Edge) Operator threshold can be adjusted to limit the edges tested to only stronger edges.
  
The latter of these two limitations makes the program difficult to use on very noisy images.
